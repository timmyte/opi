# Contributing to OPI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We're excited to collaborate with you.

Before you start, please familiarize yourself with the following guidelines.
This ensures that your contribution can be merged as soon as possible so that everyone can benefit from it.

## Reporting a Bug

A bug is a problem or unexpected behavior caused by the code in this repository.  
Please report any bugs you encounter—this is extremely valuable to us for improving the code.

Before opening a bug report:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported.
2. Check whether it still occurs or has already been fixed.  
   You might try reproducing it using the latest version from the `master` branch.
3. (Optional) Isolate the problem and create a minimal test case to demonstrate the issue.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report, and  
answer at least the following questions or choose the appropriate issue template:

1. Which version of `ORCA` are you using?
2. What is your environment (OS, Python version, etc.)?
3. What steps will reproduce the issue?  
   (We need all relevant input files to reproduce it.)
4. What is the expected outcome?
5. What did you observe instead?

All these details will help us fix potential bugs more efficiently.

## Suggesting a New Feature

Feature requests are welcome. It's helpful if you explain your requested feature in detail, describe what you want to achieve with it, and (if possible) suggest a potential solution.

## Implementing a New Feature

Contributions are very welcome via GitHub pull requests.

- Each pull request should implement *one* feature or fix *one* bug.  
  If you want to add or fix more than one thing, please submit separate pull requests.  
  This makes the history easier to track.
- Do not commit changes to files that are unrelated to your feature or bug fix.
- Ensure that the code compiles and works correctly.

After submitting the pull request, you will be asked in the PR thread to sign  
a [CLA](CLA.md) with your GitHub account.  
We will review the code as soon as possible, provide feedback, and  
you will then be able to merge the code.
